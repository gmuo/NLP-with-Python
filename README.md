# Natural language processing with Python
In this repository you can see three folders containing three main tasks this university subject consisted of. 
- Task 1: manual calculation of statistics out word counting, character partition using re and learning how to use NLTK.
- Task 2: indexing and retrieval with whoosh.
- Task 3: text processing, stereotype in text detection with regression and machine learning models (Logistic regression, Random forest, Decision forest, SVM) and ensemble models (Bagging, AdaBoost, Stacking) and BERT, as well as cross-validation with K-fold. After all that, the new knowledge was put in practice in a Kaggle competition called DETESTS hosted by IberLEF.
